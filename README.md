## User Experience
### Agile Methodology
Cuppa Cake was developed using the Agile methodology, which emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility. The site was divided into sprints, with each sprint focusing on specific features and user stories. The Agile methodology allowed for continuous feedback and improvements, ensuring that the final product meets user requirements and expectations.

### User Epics & User Stories
During the planning stage, several key epics were identified to structure the development process and ensure a comprehensive and user-centric design. Each epic is home to a series of user stories that define the scope and direction of the project. These stories are pivotal in guiding the development and ensuring that every feature contributes to a seamless and enjoyable user experience.

Each user story addresses the needs and expectations of our users and is organized within the project's kanban board, offering a detailed view of the development progress and priorities.
